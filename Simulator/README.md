I'd be happy to help you write a README for your AI-powered transaction scrutinization engine simulator. 

Could you provide more details about what you'd like the README to include? For example:

- **Project description**: What does your simulator do?
- **Features**: Key capabilities or functionality
- **Installation**: How to set it up
- **Usage**: How to run it
- **Requirements**: Dependencies, Python version, etc.
- **Configuration**: Any setup needed

Once you share more details, I can help you create a polished markdown README.
